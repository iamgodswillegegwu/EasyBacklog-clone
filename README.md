# easyBacklog

easyBacklog is an intuitive time saving backlog management tool for Agile practitioners working in or with agencies. It is designed to be not just another all purpose project management, Agile or collaboration tool for teams. It was a free service available to practitioners at easybacklog.com.

# End of life: Q3 2022

The free easyBacklog.com service shut down on 30 September 2022. When [Matthew O'Riordan](https://mattheworiordan.com) started easyBacklog, his goals were modest and straightforward, he wanted to give people an intuitive time saving backlog management tool for Agile practitioners working in or with agencies. Before it shut, nearly 400k backlogs were created by more than 55k people.

easyBacklog was shut down because the project was neglected for many years. [Matthew O'Riordan](https://mattheworiordan.com) is running [Ably](https://ably.com), a business of 150 people that he founded to provide [serverless websockets](https://ably.com/topic/websockets) and [realtime collaborative APIs](https://ably.com/features) to developers. Ably as of 2022 powers realtime experiences for more than 300 million people each month.
